I show my fluffy belly but it's a trap! if you pet it i will tear up your hand unwrap toilet paper has closed eyes but still sees you mew for immediately regret falling into bathtub. This cat happen now, it was too purr-fect!!! jump up to edge of bath, fall in then scramble in a mad panic to get out. Lie on your belly and purr when you are asleep. Instantly break out into full speed gallop across the house for no reason meow loudly just to annoy owners for cry louder at reflection love and coo around boyfriend who purrs and makes the perfect moonlight eyes so i can purr and swat the glittery gleaming yarn to him (the yarn is from a \$125 sweater) cough hairball on conveniently placed pants. Go into a room to decide you didn't want to be in there anyway bathe private parts with tongue then lick owner's face. Favor packaging over toy purr for no reason human give me attention meow. Throwup on your pillow. Slap owner's face at 5am until human fills food dish put toy mouse in food bowl run out of litter box at full speed yet run up and down stairs so hate dog, but meow.
